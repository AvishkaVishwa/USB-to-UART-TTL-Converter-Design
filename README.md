# USB to UART TTL Converter (FT232RL)

When I started designing my own custom ESP32 and STM32 boards, I quickly realized one thing:
no project moves forward without a reliable way to program and debug.

I had a few cheap USB-to-UART adapters lying around, but they often gave me unstable connections, messy wiring, or missing signals. So, instead of relying on them, I decided to design my own converter board ‚Äî something compact, robust, and dependable for daily use.

This board is built around the FT232RL chip and has since become one of the most useful tools on my bench.

## üîå Pinout
The breakout exposes the following signals:

| Pin  | Function                        |
|------|---------------------------------|
| VCC  | 3.3V / 5V Output (configurable) |
| GND  | Ground                          |
| TXD  | UART Transmit                   |
| RXD  | UART Receive                    |
| RTS  | Request To Send                 |
| DTR  | Data Terminal Ready             |

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
1. **Connect the board** to your PC using a USB cable (Micro-USB).  
2. **Install FTDI drivers** (if required):
   - [FTDI Drivers Download](https://ftdichip.com/drivers/)  
3. **Connect TX, RX, GND** to your target board (cross TX‚ÜîRX).  
4. (Optional) Use **RTS/DTR** for auto-reset and bootloader functions with ESP32/ESP8266.  
5. Open a serial monitor (e.g., Arduino IDE, PuTTY, or PlatformIO) and communicate with your target board.

## ‚ö° Applications
- Programming ESP32/STM32/AVR custom boards  
- Debugging UART logs from embedded systems  
- General USB-to-TTL serial communication
