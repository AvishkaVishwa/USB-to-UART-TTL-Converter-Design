# USB to UART TTL Converter (FT232RL)

When I started designing my own custom ESP32 and STM32 boards, I quickly realized one thing:
no project moves forward without a reliable way to program and debug.

I had a few cheap USB-to-UART adapters lying around, but they often gave me unstable connections, messy wiring, or missing signals. So, instead of relying on them, I decided to design my own converter board ‚Äî something compact, robust, and dependable for daily use.

This board is built around the FT232RL chip and has since become one of the most useful tools on my bench.

## üîå Pinout
The breakout exposes the following signals:

| Pin  | Function                        |
|------|---------------------------------|
| VCC  | 3.3V / 5V Output (configurable) |
| GND  | Ground                          |
| TXD  | UART Transmit                   |
| RXD  | UART Receive                    |
| RTS  | Request To Send                 |
| DTR  | Data Terminal Ready             |

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
1. **Connect the board** to your PC using a USB cable (Micro-USB).  
2. **Install FTDI drivers** (if required):
   - [FTDI Drivers Download](https://ftdichip.com/drivers/)  
3. **Connect TX, RX, GND** to your target board (cross TX‚ÜîRX).  
4. (Optional) Use **RTS/DTR** for auto-reset and bootloader functions with ESP32/ESP8266.  
5. Open a serial monitor (e.g., Arduino IDE, PuTTY, or PlatformIO) and communicate with your target board.

## ‚ö° Applications
- Programming ESP32/STM32/AVR custom boards  
- Debugging UART logs from embedded systems  
- General USB-to-TTL serial communication

## Behind the Build

I built this board because I wanted a reliable programmer and debug tool for my custom ESP32/STM32 designs. Many cheap adapters had poor soldering or unstable connectors, so I decided to make one myself.

- Fabrication Experience:
The fine-pitch pads of the FT232RL were a challenge, but PCBWay‚Äôs tight tolerance and smooth ENIG finish made soldering much easier, even by hand. The black solder mask also gave it a professional look, even though it‚Äôs just a small utility board.

- Service Choices:
2-layer board.
ENIG surface finish for solderability.

I would like to give a huge shoutout and sincere thanks to **[PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/)** for sponsoring the PCB fabrication of this project!
 
With the **fine-pitch FT232RL IC**, pad accuracy and **ENIG finish** were crucial for easy soldering  and PCBWay‚Äôs work exceeded expectations.  
I the finish quality gave it a professional look far beyond a typical DIY tool.

This project wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without their generous support. If you‚Äôre looking to manufacture professional-grade PCBs at an affordable price, I highly recommend checking them out.
